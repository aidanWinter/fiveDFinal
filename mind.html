  <p>Exercise 1: Tension Release</p>
  <h2>Find a quiet, dark room where you can sit or lie comfortably. Focus on the tension in your muscles and joints, starting from the top of your head. Concentrate on the tension - squeeze your muscles firmly for ten seconds and then release, allowing the tension to leave your body.</h2>
  <h2>Work your way down your body, from your head and your eyes to your neck and shoulders, down to your arms and abdomen, to your hips and thighs, down to your knees calves and finally your ankles and feet.</h2>
  <h2>As you squeeze each muscle group, block out any distractions and focus only on releasing the tension from your muscles and joints and refreshing your body.</h2>
  <h2>Complete this exercise as many times as needed. Be sure to take a moment once you are done and continue to sit or lie down and allow your body to release any residual tension or stress.</h2>
</div>

<div class="ex1" style='float:left; width:29%; margin-left:50px; text-align: left; overflow: scroll;'>
  <p>Exercise 2: Breathing</p>
  <h2>Observe your body as you breath in slowly through your nose. Hold your breathe for six seconds before slowly releasing your breathe through your mouth.</h2>
  <h2>Pay attention to how your chest moves up and down with each breathe, and how your lungs fill with the air. Let go of all other thoughts and concerns, focusing only on how your body rises and falls with each new breathe</h2>
  <h2>After 10-20 cycles of slow, deep breathes, begin to pay attention to the movement and sounds of your surroundings. Feel the energy of each breathe as it leaves your body and enters the room.</h2>
  <h2>Observe how your breathing changes as you become reaware of your surroundings, and adjust if needed to maintain consistent, slow, deep breathes. When you feel ready, refocus your attention to the room and complete the exercise.</h2>

  <p>Exercise 3: S.T.O.P.</p>
  <h2>Remember to S.T.O.P.</h2>
  <h2>S: Stand up and breathe. With your eyes closed, take a minute to reconnect with your surroundings, feeling how you are interacting with the environment around you.</h2>
  <h2>T: Tune in with your body and how you are feeling. Notice the physical sensations coarsing through your body, releasing the negative feelings through your breathing to make room for the positive emotions and sensations.</h2>
  <h2>O: Observe your surrounding space. Identify something in your environment that brings you joy and peace of mind. Try to notice something you often overlook.</h2>
  <h2>P: Possibility. Ask yourself what happens next, and how you can use your space to remotivate yourself to accomplish your next goal. Then do it. </h2>
